"""
Useful functions for calculating light interaction at planar boundaries.

The underlying assumptions are that there a two semi-infinite media with a
planar interface.  For convenience, assume the light is incident from the top.
The upper medium is characterized by a purely real index of refraction `n_i` which
has a default value of 1.  The lower medium is characterized by a complex index
of refraction `m = n - n * kappa * 1j`.  Note that `pypolar` assumes the sign
of the imaginary part of the index of refraction is negative.

The Fresnel equations assume that the electric field has been decomposed into
fields relative to the plane of incidence (a plane defined by the incoming
light direction and the normal to the surface).

The incidence angle is measured from the normal to the surface and is measured
in radians.

To Do::
    * Make sure routines work for arrays of m or of theta_i
    * fail for positive imaginary refractive indices
    * fail for out-of-range angles to catch degrees/radians error
